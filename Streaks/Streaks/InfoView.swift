                    This app is designed to help you stick to a consistent routine.
                    It is based on the belief that there are no shortcuts; incremental improvement is the way to self-development.

                    Take advantage of the 'streak mentality'.
                    Game-ify the mundane.
                    Set rewards for reaching milestones.
                    Watch yourself transform into your ideal self.
